The official repository for snak Linux.

This is a fork of KISS Linux aimed at including snapd. This is a personal
project with the ultimate goal of providing myself with a robust enough
development environment that I don't *need* to use Ubuntu, but don't miss out on
the benefits of snap packaging.

!!This is highly unstable!!

More information forthcoming.
